## Common Fields

This Drupal module defines common fields that are used throughout many, if not all, Drupal website builds.

This module overrides the Drupal Field UI within the administration allowing for defined, non-instantiated, fields to be used. This enhancement ensures that this Common Fields component's defined fields can be selected as existing fields even if they do not have instances yet created.

### Fields
